 *
 * Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is
 * the price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee
 * representing a transaction fee.
 * You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the
 * transaction fee for each transaction.  You may not buy more than 1 share of
 * a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)
 * Return the maximum profit you can make.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
 * Buying at prices[0] = 1Selling at prices[3] = 8Buying at prices[4] =
 * 4Selling at prices[5] = 9The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) =
 * 8.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 0 < prices.length .
 * 0 < prices[i] < 50000.
 * 0 .
